# Day 1 (04/06/2025)

What else to say...? 

Ms. Hanh is the lecturer of this course and although laboratory session went quite hard (lack of time when do solo work) but I have to say her guide and slides are great, really easy to understand.

I did complete some lines of code need for basic, such as .g4 and the generate ANTLR4 file. Trying to do as much as I can. Wish me luck.

Maybe I'll yap something in this and **REALLY DO SUBMIT THIS** if none of my team members join.

That's all for today,
