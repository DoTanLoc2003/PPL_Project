# Day 2

Well... it's me again.
I checked all the labs and search ~~GPT~~ a lot. Somehow I completed the CartVisitor and chatbox.py. There are a issues about the grammar and how I handled the the tree and visit: I forgot to get check for every single step: command, conditionalCommand, addProduct, ...
However, I checked the most simple command:
```
add 1 iPhone
view cart
check out
```
Well... that's all the work i have done for 12 hours from the first commit. Oh, I forgot to commit how to run the code first.
Thanks Ms Hanh's Sample codes a lot that I can *borrow without permission* to create ANTLR, CompiledFiles, import the Lexer, Parser, Visitor. Without them, well... I must be dead. Once again, thank you, Ms Hanh!!

That's all for today,
